* You can now pass on a dictionary as an argument which will be unpacked accordingly using the ``**``-operator.

  tuples out of an iterable of single arguments.

  CPU or range of CPUs that have to be shared between all child processes.

0.5.0
-----

*(2017-10-06)*

* Added CPU pinning.
* Default number of processes to spawn when using ``n_jobs=None`` is now set to the number of CPUs available, instead of
  ``cpu_count() - 1``.

0.4.0
-----

*(2017-10-05)*

* Workers can now be started as normal child processes (non-deamon) such that nested :obj:`mpire.WorkerPool` s are
  possible.

-----

*(2017-09-15)*

* The worker ID can now be passed on the function to be executed by using the :meth:`mpire.WorkerPool.pass_on_worker_id`
